"""Question 4: For Loops (5 points)

Write a program to calculate the average number of students taking Programming Logic. 
Write a program that uses a for loop to ask the user for number of students in each of 
the last four semesters.  Your for loop should contain an input statement to ask the user 
for a number. Add up all of the quantities, and divide by 4 to calculate the average.   

Print the average number of students registered for Programming Logic over the last four semesters. 

For example, The number of students registered in Programming Logic class for the last 4 semesters 
was 92, 84, 73, and 90.  The total students in the last 4 semesters was 339. 
The average is 339 / 4 = 84.75 students."""
