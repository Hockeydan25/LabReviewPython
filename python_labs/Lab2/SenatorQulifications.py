""" Question 2:
Can you be a senator?

Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution sets out three qualifications for senators:

(1) they must be at least 30 years old,
(2) they must have been citizens of the United States for at least the past nine years, and
(3) they must live in the state they seek to represent at the time of their election.

Write a program that asks the user four questions:

the state they want to be a senator in,
their age, as an int number,
if they have been a citizen of the US for at least 9 years. If someone is not a US citizen, they will enter 0,
the state they currently live in.  (to be eligible, this needs to be the same as the state they want to be 
the senator of). """
